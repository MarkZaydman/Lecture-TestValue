### Introduction

Heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a rare complication of exposure to the anticoagulant drug heparin. Patients with HIT are at a high risk for potentially devastating arterial or venous thrombosis. This risk can be reduced by withdrawing heparin medications and initiating and alternative anticoagulant, such as a direct thrombin inhibitor. However, these treatments are costly, require IV access, and carry a risk of major bleeding complications. 

The PF4 Ab assay that detects antibodies against heparin/PF4 complexes such those that cause HIT. This test has high sensitivity, but limited specificity due to the detection of other non-pathogenic antibodies. In this activity you will consider if and when the PF4 Ab test provides value.

## Part 1: Accuracy of the PF4 Ab screen


Here are the results of a hypothetical case control study:

<block style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;margin-top:40px;margin-bottom:40px">

<table>
  <tr align='center'>
    <th><ins>HIT</ins></th>
    <td>PF4 Ab OD >0.4
    <td>PF4 Ab OD <= 0.4
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="right">Diseased</td>
    <td align='center'>194</td>
    <td align='center'>6</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="right">Healthy</td>
    <td align='center'>26</td>
    <td align='center'>174</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</block>


From these data:

1. Estimate the sensitivity and specificity
<br>
<br>
2. Estimate the LR+ and LR-
<br>
<br>
3. Estimate the DOR
<br>
<br>

## Part 2: PF4 Ab value in a low pretest probability patient

Using the estimates from part 1 and assuming a pretest probability of 2%, estimate the following:

1. PPV and NPV
<br>
<br>
2. Post-test probability
<br>
<br>

Did the PF4 Ab result provide value for this patient? 
<br>
<br>
## Part 3: PF4 Ab value in an intermediate pretest probability patient

Using the estimates from part 1 and assuming a pretest probability of 10%, estimate the following:

1. PPV and NPV
<br>
<br>
2. Post-test probability
<br>
<br>

Did the PF4 Ab result provide value for this patient? 
<br>
<br>

## Part 4: PF4 Ab value in an high pretest probability patient

Using the estimates from part 1 and assuming a pretest probability of 70%, estimate the following:

1. PPV and NPV
<br>
<br>
2. Post-test probability
<br>
<br>

Did the PF4 Ab result provide value for this patient? 
<br>
<br>
